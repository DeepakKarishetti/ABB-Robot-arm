# ABB-Robot-arm
Library which consists of all the necessary functions to compute the forward and inverse kinematics of an ABB-robot arm to simulate its motion to do a predefined task


**Project abstract:**

 - The purpose of this project is to build up a core set of MATLAB functions and use them in a model consisting of a robotic
arm and designing a control system for it in order to execute a trajectory for the described mechanism, using Simulink.

 - The first two parts of the project required us to write MATLAB functions that are necessary for the kinematic and dynamic
control of the manipulator. It consists of many functions involving Forward dynamics, Inverse dynamics, Velocity Jacobian and
the Newton Euler functions.

 - These functions along with others are used to define the parameters and the working of the manipulator.
 
 - The third part of the project is to design a controller for the given arm manipulator that is made to execute a Cartesian
trajectory for the ABB mechanism in the specified time intervals and orientation at a constant speed.

 - The model is an ABB arm manipulator having six degrees of freedom and having joints, all being revolute joints.
